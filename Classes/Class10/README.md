We are also covering [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) in more detail.  

## GitHub Pages  
  
### User page  
To create a user page, use your personal github account (e.g. @blordcastillo).  
In your personal account (not in your class repository), create a new repository named ```<accountname>>.github.io```.
  
Example: [https://github.com/blordcastillo/blordcastillo.github.io](https://github.com/blordcastillo/blordcastillo.github.io)  
  
This repository is known as a GitHub pages repository. Create an ```index.html``` file in this repository, and it will be the default page at ```<accountname>>.github.io```.  
It will probably take several minutes for this page to show up the first time you create it.  
Other html files that you place in this directory will be publicly available too. Here are some examples:  
http://blordcastillo.github.io/
http://blordcastillo.github.io/index.html *This should be the same page as above*
http://blordcastillo.github.io/map.html
