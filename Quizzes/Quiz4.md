Quiz 4 - Task Scheduler
  1. When scheduling a task to run when you are *not* logged into the computer,  
     can you use a credential without a password (Such as LabUser)?
  
     *No*  
  
  2. If you do provide a credential, and you later change the password for that credential,  
     does Task Scheduler automatically updated itself for the new password?
  
     *No*  
  
  3. If you provide a script file as the program to execute, what is the difference  
     between executing a .py file and a .pyw file?
  
     *A .py file runs windowed while a .pyw file runs headless (no window pops up).*  
  
  4. If you want to precisely control which installation of python is used to execute your script,
     what should use as your program to execute, and what should you use as an "Argument"?
  
     *The program to execute should be the python.exe or pythonw.exe executible for that installation, e.g. C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.2\pythonw.exe*  
     *The argument should then be the path to the .py or .pyw script that you are executing.*  
  
  5. What is the effect of providing a "Start in" option when setting up an Action?
  
     *The "Start in" folder will become the default workspace for the script you are executing.*
